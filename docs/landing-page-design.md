     It is here as well as installed as a Claude skill because this machine's

     READ THIS BEFORE ANY LANDING PAGE WORK. One caveat: it mandates a fresh
     palette and rotated display fonts for every project ("no hex code memory",
     "font rotation required"). ChessForge's landing page is explicitly NOT to
     be re-themed -- the owner asked for the dark/cyan palette and Sora +
     Manrope to stay. Take its structure, copy and anti-slop advice; ignore the
     instruction to generate new colours and fonts. -->

# Landing Page Design

## Overview
Build landing pages that convert AND captivate. This skill combines conversion-focused structure with distinctive visual design to create pages that stand out in an AI-saturated world. The goal: pages worth $50-100 that you'd be proud to sell.

## MANDATORY: Vibe Discovery (Do This First)

**BEFORE writing any code, you MUST run the Vibe Discovery process.** This isn't a lookup table - it's a creative prompt that generates a UNIQUE aesthetic direction every time.

The goal: No two landing pages should look alike, even for similar products.

---

### The Vibe Discovery Process

**Ask the user these questions, then SYNTHESIZE a unique direction. Don't just map answers to presets.**

#### Step 1: Gather Context (Ask These)

**Q1: What's one real-world place or object this brand would be?**
> Not "what industry" - an actual specific thing. A Tokyo convenience store at 2am. A grandmother's kitchen. A brutalist parking garage. A coral reef. The cockpit of a 747. A flea market in Marrakech. A 1970s recording studio.

**Q2: What's the ONE emotion someone should feel in the first 3 seconds?**
> Pick ONE: Calm. Energized. Curious. Trusted. Delighted. Impressed. Rebellious. Nostalgic. Inspired. Amused. Sophisticated. Welcomed. Intrigued. Confident.

**Q3: Pick TWO unexpected influences to collide:**
> Examples: "medical packaging + skateboard graphics", "spreadsheets + street art", "luxury hotel + punk zine", "NASA mission control + kindergarten", "Japanese convenience store + Victorian library"

**Q4: What should this page NEVER be mistaken for?**
> Name 2-3 specific things to actively avoid. "A crypto project", "A wellness app", "Something made by a bank", "Anything with purple gradients"

#### Step 2: Invent The Aesthetic (Don't Look Up - Create)

Based on the answers, CREATE a unique vibe by deciding:

**COLOR INVENTION** (Don't use memorized palettes - derive from the place/object)
- What colors exist in that real-world place/object from Q1?
- Extract 3-4 colors that feel authentic to that reference
- Invent specific hex codes fresh - don't reuse codes from previous projects
- Name your palette something evocative (not "blue and orange" but "Midnight Bodega" or "Rust Belt Morning")

**TYPOGRAPHY INVENTION** (Match the voice to the collision)
- What would text sound like in that place?
- Find a display font that embodies the collision from Q3
- Don't default to your usual choices - browse Google Fonts with fresh eyes
- Consider: weight, width, contrast, quirks

**LAYOUT INVENTION** (Derive from the physical space)
- How is space organized in that place from Q1?
- Is it cramped or expansive? Grid-like or organic? Vertical or horizontal?
- What unexpected layout choice would embody the collision from Q3?

**MOTION INVENTION** (Match the emotion)
- How does the emotion from Q2 move?
- Calm = barely perceptible. Energized = kinetic. Sophisticated = slow and deliberate.
- What's ONE signature motion that defines this page?

#### Step 3: Write Your Vibe Spec

Before coding, write this out explicitly:

```
VIBE NAME: [Invent a 2-3 word name]
REFERENCE: [The place/object from Q1]
EMOTION: [From Q2]
COLLISION: [From Q3]
ANTI-PATTERNS: [From Q4]

COLORS:
- Primary: [hex] - [why this color]
- Secondary: [hex] - [why]
- Background: [hex] - [why]
- Accent: [hex] - [why]
- Palette name: [evocative name]

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Display: [specific font name] - [why it fits]
- Body: [specific font name] - [why]
- Character: [describe the voice]

LAYOUT:
- Density: [sparse/balanced/dense]
- Shapes: [sharp/rounded/organic/mixed]
- Signature element: [one unusual layout choice]

MOTION:
- Level: [still/subtle/moderate/dynamic/chaotic]
- Signature animation: [one specific animation that defines this]

WILDCARD:
- One unexpected detail that doesn't "match" but makes it memorable
```

#### Step 4: The Freshness Check

Before proceeding, verify:
- [ ] I did NOT reuse hex codes from my last 3 projects
- [ ] I did NOT default to my "comfortable" fonts (check: am I using Inter? Nunito? Space Grotesk? If yes, find something else)
- [ ] The collision from Q3 is actually visible in my choices
- [ ] Someone could NOT mistake this for my previous landing pages
- [ ] I included a wildcard that surprises even me

---

### Example Vibe Discovery

**Q1 - Place/Object:** "A Japanese train station at rush hour"

**Q2 - Emotion:** "Confident"

**Q3 - Collision:** "Transit signage + haute couture"

**Q4 - Never mistaken for:** "A meditation app, anything whimsical, startup-bro tech"

**Generated Vibe Spec:**

```
VIBE NAME: Shinjuku Runway
REFERENCE: Japanese train station at rush hour
EMOTION: Confident
COLLISION: Transit signage + haute couture
ANTI-PATTERNS: No soft gradients, no playful illustrations, no rounded friendly shapes

COLORS:
- Primary: #1a1a1a - the black of train doors
- Secondary: #f5f5f0 - platform concrete, worn smooth
- Background: #fafaf8 - fluorescent-lit white
- Accent: #e60012 - JR line red, commanding attention
- Palette name: "Platform Edge"

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Display: Darker Grotesque - confident, slightly condensed, European edge
- Body: Noto Sans JP - clean utility, transit-inspired
- Character: Authoritative but not cold. Clear. Directional.

LAYOUT:
- Density: Rich but organized - like a station map
- Shapes: Sharp with intentional rounded exceptions (like train windows)
- Signature element: Strong horizontal bands that divide sections like train schedules

MOTION:
- Level: Subtle but precise
- Signature animation: Elements slide in from the side like arriving trains - horizontal, smooth, with exact timing

WILDCARD:
- One element uses a fabric-like texture overlay - the haute couture collision
```

### Inspiration Starters (When Stuck on Q1)

**Spaces:**
Night market in Bangkok | Empty museum at closing | Airport lounge at 4am |
Vintage record store | Hospital waiting room | Casino floor |
Greenhouse in winter | Subway platform | Observatory dome |
Abandoned factory | Luxury yacht interior | 24-hour laundromat |
Library rare books room | Auto body shop | Space station module

**Objects:**
1980s synthesizer | Surgical instruments | Vintage luggage |
Racing motorcycle | Antique compass | Industrial loom |
Neon sign | Typewriter | Scientific glassware |
Leather-bound book | Circuit board | Porcelain dishware

**Eras/Movements:**
Soviet constructivism | Memphis design | Swiss international |
Art nouveau | Bauhaus | De Stijl |
Googie architecture | Streamline moderne | Brutalism |
Japanese metabolism | Scandinavian modernism | Italian futurism

---

### The Anti-Convergence Rules

1. **No hex code memory** - Generate colors fresh from the reference, don't recall "my usual blue"
2. **Font rotation required** - Cannot use the same display font in consecutive projects
3. **Collision must show** - If someone can't see BOTH influences from Q3, push harder
4. **Wildcard is mandatory** - Every vibe needs one element that doesn't "fit" but makes it unique
5. **Name it** - An unnamed vibe becomes generic. A named vibe has identity.

---

### Quick Context Questions (Minimal Version)

If the user just says "make me a landing page" with no context, ask:

1. "What's one place or object that captures this brand's energy?"
2. "What emotion should dominate?"
3. "What should this NEVER look like?"

Then synthesize a vibe from those three answers.

---

## MANDATORY: Copy Strategy (Do This With Vibe Discovery)

**Run this IN PARALLEL with Vibe Discovery.** Vibe Discovery gives you the look. Copy Strategy gives you the words. Both must be done before any code.

### The Conversion Equation

Every copy decision flows from this:

```
Purchase Rate = Desire - (Labor + Confusion)
```

- **Increase desire** → communicate value clearly and specifically
- **Decrease labor** → brevity, scannable structure, obvious next actions
- **Decrease confusion** → say exactly what it is, make buttons unmissable

If you're stuck on a copy decision, ask: "Does this increase desire or decrease labor/confusion?"

### Step 1: Objection Discovery

Before writing a single headline, identify the buying objections. Ask the user:

**"What almost stopped your customers from buying?"**
**"Why haven't non-customers bought yet?"**

Common objection categories:
- "I don't have the skills/time for this"
- "This won't work for my specific situation"
- "It's too expensive for what I get"
- "I don't trust this enough yet"
- "I don't understand what this actually does"

Write down the top 3 objections. These drive your headline hook, feature copy, and CTA framing.

### Step 2: Headline Formula

Every hero headline follows: **Value Prop + Hook**

The **value prop** must pass this litmus test:
> If a visitor sees ONLY the headline and nothing else, will they know exactly what you sell?

❌ "Improve your workflow" (corporate fluff — workflow for what?)
❌ "The future of productivity" (says nothing concrete)
✅ "Groceries delivered in 1 hour" (specific, concrete, clear)
✅ "Design websites visually — no code required" (what it does + key objection handled)

The **hook** is one of two types:

**Type A — Bold, specific claim** (triggers curiosity):
- "Cut deploy time from 4 hours to 12 minutes"
- "10,000 teams shipped faster last month"

**Type B — Objection addressed** (removes the #1 buying barrier):
- "No credit card required" (handles trust objection)
- "Works with your existing tools" (handles switching-cost objection)
- "Set up in 5 minutes" (handles effort objection)

Use your top objection from Step 1 to pick the hook type.

### Step 3: Subheadline Rules

The subheadline does exactly two things:
1. Explains **what** the product is (if the headline was benefit-focused)
2. Explains **how** the bold claim is possible (if the headline made a claim)

Max: 1-2 sentences. Keep it breezy. If you need three sentences, your headline isn't doing enough work.

### Step 4: Feature Copy Structure

Each feature gets exactly three elements:

| Element | Rules |
|---------|-------|
| **Feature header** | Short value prop only. Be blunt. ❌ "Empower your team" ✅ "Real-time collaboration" |
| **Feature paragraph** | Concise description + address ONE critical objection. Link to details if needed — no walls of text. |
| **Feature image** | Show the product IN ACTION. For software: GIFs > screenshots > abstract art. For physical goods: use cases + build quality close-ups. |

Every feature should tie back to the hero's dominant value prop. Features aren't random — they're evidence for the claim you made above the fold.

### Step 5: CTA Copy

CTAs must **continue the hero's narrative**, not be generic.

❌ "Get started" / "Request demo" / "Sign up" (lazy, context-free)
✅ "Find food near me" (continues a delivery narrative)
✅ "Start designing" (continues a design tool narrative)
✅ "See your savings" (continues a financial narrative)

The CTA button text should feel like the natural next sentence after reading the headline.

### Step 6: Social Proof Strategy

**If you have notable customers/press:**
- Display logos in a marquee — creates FOMO ("everyone already knows about this")
- Highlight impressive metrics (customer count, revenue processed, etc.)

**If you DON'T have notable social proof yet (cold start):**
- Offer free access to 3-5 recognizable companies, then display their logos
- Use specific testimonials with real names and photos (even from beta users)
- Show aggregate stats ("Used by 500+ teams" beats an empty logo bar)
- Consider "As seen in" with any press mentions, podcasts, or newsletters

Don't fake it. An empty social proof section is worse than no section at all.

### Step 7: Multi-Audience Routing

If your product serves distinct personas (e.g., individuals vs. teams, developers vs. designers):

Add a **"choose your own adventure"** element near the top of the page that routes visitors to relevant sections. Examples:
- Toggle tabs: "For Developers" / "For Designers"
- Split hero: "I'm a [role A]" / "I'm a [role B]"
- Segmented landing pages linked from the hero

Don't force everyone through the same funnel if they have different needs.

### Copy Strategy Spec

Write this out alongside your Vibe Spec:

```
TOP 3 OBJECTIONS:
1. [objection] → addressed in: [headline/feature/CTA]
2. [objection] → addressed in: [headline/feature/CTA]
3. [objection] → addressed in: [headline/feature/CTA]

HEADLINE:
- Value prop: [what you sell, concretely]
- Hook type: [bold claim / objection addressed]
- Full headline: [the actual text]
- Litmus test: Would someone know what we sell from this alone? [yes/no]

SUBHEADLINE: [1-2 sentences — what it is + how the claim works]

CTA TEXT: [narrative continuation of headline]

AUDIENCE: [single / multi-persona]
- If multi: [how we route them]
```

---

## The 50% Rule
**Spend 50% of your time on the hero section.** It's the cover image for social media, the first impression, the hook. Everything else flows from getting the hero right.

## Section Composition (Top to Bottom)

### 1. Hero Section (Primary Focus)
The make-or-break element. Must contain:
- **Headline**: Value Prop + Hook from your Copy Strategy Spec (see above). Must pass the litmus test — if someone sees ONLY this, do they know what you sell?
- **Subheadline**: Explains what it is + how the claim works. 1-2 sentences max, keep it breezy.
- **CTA Button(s)**: Narrative continuation of headline (not "Get Started" — see CTA Copy rules above). Optional secondary CTA.
- **Social Proof**: Logo marquee, testimonials, or trust badges. If cold-starting, see Social Proof Strategy above.
- **Visual Element**: Product shot, illustration, or animated background

**Hero Variations**:
- Split layout (text left, visual right)
- Centered with floating elements
- Full-bleed background with overlay text
- Asymmetric with decorative elements

### 2. Features/Benefits Section
Show what the product does. Each feature needs three elements: **header** (short value prop, no "Empower/Revolutionize"), **paragraph** (concise + address ONE objection), **image** (product in action, not abstract art). Every feature should reference the hero's dominant value prop.

Layout options:
- **Bento Grid**: Cards in asymmetric layout (popularized by Apple)
- **Alternating Rows**: Image + text, flipping sides
- **Icon Grid**: Simple icons with short descriptions
- **Interactive Cards**: Hover states, micro-animations

### 3. Social Proof Section
Build trust through:
- Logo carousel (marquee animation)
- Testimonial cards with photos
- Stats/metrics with animated counters
- Case study snippets

### 4. How It Works Section
Step-by-step explanation:
- Numbered steps (01, 02, 03 pattern adds sophistication)
- Sticky scrolling with progressive reveal
- Timeline or flowchart visualization

### 5. Pricing Section (if applicable)
- 2-3 tier comparison
- Highlighted "recommended" tier
- Feature comparison table
- FAQ accordion below

### 6. CTA Section
Final conversion push:
- Repeat value proposition (callback to hero headline)
- Strong headline that re-frames the original hook
- Single focused action — same narrative CTA from hero, not a different one
- Urgency elements (if authentic — never manufactured)

### 7. Footer
- Navigation links
- Social icons
- Legal links
- Optional newsletter signup

## Anti-AI-Slop Principles

### Icons: Avoid Lucide (Overused)
Use instead:
- **Iconify Solar**: Multiple styles (outline, broken, duotone)
- **Heroicons**: When you need Apple-like simplicity
- **Phosphor**: Flexible weight system
- **Custom SVGs**: For brand differentiation

### Fonts: Kill Inter/Roboto
Distinctive alternatives:
- **Display**: Newsreader, Playfair Display, Space Grotesk, Clash Display
- **Body**: Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans, Manrope, Satoshi
- **Mono**: JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Fira Code

### Colors: No Purple Gradients
Bold alternatives:
- Deep navy + electric accent
- Warm neutrals + single pop color
- Monochromatic with tonal depth
- Dark mode with neon accents
- Earthy/organic palettes

### Layouts: Break the Grid
- Overlapping elements
- Diagonal sections
- Asymmetric spacing
- Container-breaking hero elements
- Negative space as design element

## Animation Vocabulary

### Entrance Animations
- `fade-in`: Simple opacity transition
- `blur-in`: Starts blurred, sharpens
- `slide-in`: Direction-based entrance
- `scale-in`: Grows from small to full size
- `stagger`: Sequential reveal of child elements

### Continuous Animations
- `marquee`: Infinite horizontal scroll (logos, testimonials)
- `beam`: Light traveling along a path/border
- `pulse`: Subtle scale/opacity breathing
- `float`: Gentle up/down movement
- `rotate`: Continuous spin (icons, decorations)

### Interactive Animations
- `hover-lift`: Subtle Y translation + shadow
- `hover-glow`: Border/shadow color change
- `hover-reveal`: Hidden element appears
- `click-ripple`: Material-style feedback

### Decorative Elements
- Vertical grid lines (container-size based)
- Noodles/curved connectors between elements
- Gradient orbs/blobs in background
- Grain/noise texture overlay
- Geometric shapes (circles, rectangles with rounded corners)

## Design Resources

### Hero Inspiration
- **Superhero** (superhero.design): Curated hero sections
- **Dribbble**: Search "hero section", "landing page"
- **Awwwards**: Award-winning designs

### Section Patterns
- **Mobin**: Real websites with section breakdowns
- **Bento Grids**: Card layout inspiration
- **CTA Gallery**: Call-to-action patterns

### Typography
- **Google Fonts**: Free, AI-accessible fonts
- **Fontshare**: Free quality fonts
- **H1 Gallery**: Headline inspiration

### Icons & Logos
- **Iconify**: Unified icon API (Solar, Heroicons, etc.)
- **Simple Icons**: Brand logos (SVG)
- **Heroicons**: Tailwind's icon set

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Strategy
1. Run Vibe Discovery (aesthetic direction) and Copy Strategy (words/conversion) in parallel
2. Write both specs before touching code
3. Gather 5-10 hero screenshots as wireframes
4. Identify section patterns needed
5. Choose icon set and font pairing

### Phase 2: Hero Development
1. Generate hero from best reference screenshot
2. Iterate: change colors, fonts, layouts
3. Add animations (beam, fade-in, etc.)
4. Add decorative elements (noodles, grids, numbers)
5. Refine until distinctive

### Phase 3: Section Build-Out
1. Add sections one at a time (not all at once)
2. Reference specific components/screenshots per section
3. Maintain color/font consistency from hero
4. Add section-specific animations

### Phase 4: Polish
1. Fix responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. Replace placeholder images with real/quality assets
3. Optimize animations for performance
4. Test all interactive elements

### Phase 5: Presentation
1. Create cover screenshot with infinity canvas layout
2. Show hero prominently
3. Include mobile and desktop views
4. Add subtle background (blurred gradient, pattern)

## Prompt Patterns

### Hero Generation
```
Create a hero section for [PRODUCT TYPE].
Change text, names, and numbers to fit [BRAND].
Use Iconify Solar icons (duotone style).
Use [FONT] for headlines.
Add vertical container-size grid lines.
Add 01, 02, 03 step indicators for sophistication.
Use [COLOR] as primary, dark mode.
```

### Section Addition
```
Adapt a new [SECTION TYPE] section.
Match the hero's color scheme and typography.
Use marquee animation for logos.
Add fade-in blur-in entrance animation.
Keep the hero exactly as is.
```

### Animation Enhancement
```
Add beam animation to the primary button border.
The beam should be 1px, continuously traveling around the pill shape.
Add a subtle hover-lift effect to feature cards.
```

### Negative Prompts (What NOT to change)
```
Don't change the hero section.
Keep the navbar exactly as is.
Don't modify the existing animations.
```

### User Testing Framework (Post-Build)

Before shipping, get feedback from **two types of reviewers**:

**Type A — Non-market people** (test comprehension):
- Can they explain what you sell after 5 seconds?
- What questions remain unanswered?

**Type B — Market-aware people** (test differentiation):
- How does this compare to competitors they know?
- What would make them switch?

**Ask these 6 questions:**
1. **Conversion**: Would you sign up right now? What's stopping you?
2. **Interest**: Rate 1-10. What would you rewrite?
3. **Clarity**: What's confusing? What questions do you still have?
4. **Expansion**: What deserves more detail?
5. **Brevity**: If you had to cut 50%, what goes?
6. **Disbelief**: What triggered skepticism?
